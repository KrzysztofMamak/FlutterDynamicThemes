# FlutterDynamicThemes

## Description

This is a sample flutter application which shows how to manage themes dynamically. It's based on a [Reso Coder tutorial](https://youtu.be/YYbhkg-W8Mg). The only difference is that this app uses [Freezed package](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) to work with BLoC.
